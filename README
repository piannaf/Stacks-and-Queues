Complete assignment 1 for COMP3506 at the University of Queensland

Description:
	Implement abstract data types (ADTs) for array and link based stacks and
	queues. Also, a short report to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses.
	
	The array-based data structures were partially written for us and we 
	needed to fix them to pass the given tests and ensure they will pass
	any other relevent test thrown at them.
	
	The link-based data structures had to be implemented from scratch. Only 
	the interfaces were given.
